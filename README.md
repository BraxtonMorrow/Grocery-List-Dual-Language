# SNHU-Repository
**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**
For this project, the problem we were solving is that we were given a grocery list(input file) and were required to read through the data, remove any duplicates and keep track of how many of each item, allowing a presumably employee for a company to be able to call this information at whim in various forms.

**What did you do particularly well?**
I belive my use of functions in this projet was excellent. They were all modular functions, allowing me to call them whenever I needed and use them to only do one specific task, so to do other tasks I call functions multiple times

**Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?**
The code that was prewritten for us allowing us to access python using C++ functions. It was difficult to understand when to use which function intially. As well as the fact coding in two languages is very hard as you have to remember the syntax for both. Howvever due to google existing, this becomes much easier.

**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
Like I said before I made all my functions modular, so each function only does one thing, labeling it clearly, so you know what each function does. I call a function when I want it to do something, so ideally I call functions inside other functions, allowing my code to be more readable, and have the possibility for someone else to add to my code.
